# Churn Prediction - Eduardo Chaves

- Streamlit Deploy: https://churn-prediction-eduardochaves.streamlit.app/

This is my first DS (Data Science) project, in which was about churn cases from clients in a telecomunication company. This was a challenge from the first DS course I did.

With this project, I earned the second place at this challenge in my class and a three month internship position at Procenge (one of the oldest tech companies in Brazil).

You can see my work precess by looking at the two Jupyter Notebooks on this repository, one that I used for the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and the second one to develop the machine learning pipeline. In those files I wrote some comments to help you understand my train of thought.

I did also a front-end web application using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/ 'Streamlit Website') so you can interact with the machine learning model I trained. And you can also see some basic information about the training data set used on the project.
